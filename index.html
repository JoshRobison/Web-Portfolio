        <article>
        <p>I worked in many different feilds of work, I worked as a hay worker for 5 years before finishing highschool, where I then entered the plumbing feild with my father. After 3 years of plumbing and learning the in and outs of construction, service and peoples sewer systems i decided it was time for a change to something more clean.</p>
        <p>So I joined the thinkful program to begin my coding journey, and couldn't be happier with the progress I am making each day. I am excited to work with other programmers on projects in the future and show my progress and passion for the work we do. </p>
        <p>Oh and I also Tutored geometry, and teach people to play guitar, which I have been doing over 4 years. And much more but you will have to hire me to learn all the other interesting things I have to offer.</p>
